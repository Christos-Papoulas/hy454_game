## Tutorial for allegro
###Beggining Tutorial

The problem is that the documentation that exists in the wild is only for the old version of allegro 4.2.x
So, in order to work well with Allegro 5 the [basic guide](http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Allegro_5) is good start!

###Reference Manual.
When we have understand the basic of Allegro, we will need a [full reference manual](http://alleg.strangesoft.net/docs/refman.pdf)
and start building efficient Allegro Programs.

## Tutorial for C++

A basic guide ["From C to C++!"](http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/cppcen.html) is a good chance to start. But as we continue, we need a [full guide of C++](http://e-maxx.ru/bookz/files/stroustrup.pdf).
