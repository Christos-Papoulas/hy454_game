## Description

In this project we implemented a subset of the game “Super Mario Bros”.
Mario is able to walk, run, jump, duck, get into pipes, collect power-ups (except the flower)
and stump on enemies. He can also break brick blocks and hit “?” blocks for coins
and power-ups. The game finishes when Mario enters the castle at the end of the
level.

The Mario franchise consists of video games published and produced
by Nintendo starring the fictional character, Mario. It was originally created by game
designer Shigeru Miyamoto with the arcade Donkey Kong, released on July 9, 1981.
The games have been developed by a variety of developers including
Nintendo, Hudson Soft, and AlphaDream. Most Mario games have either been
released for the arcade or Nintendo video game consoles and handhelds dating from
the Nintendo Entertainment System to the current generation of video game
consoles. The main series in the franchise is the Super Mario platform series, which
mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the Mushroom Kingdom.
These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress
through levels

## Tutorial for allegro
###Beggining Tutorial

The problem is that the documentation that exists in the wild is only for the old version of allegro 4.2.x
So, in order to work well with Allegro 5 the [basic guide](http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Allegro_5) is good start!

###Reference Manual.
When we have understand the basic of Allegro, we will need a [full reference manual](http://alleg.strangesoft.net/docs/refman.pdf)
and start building efficient Allegro Programs.

## Tutorial for C++

A basic guide ["From C to C++!"](http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/cppcen.html) is a good chance to start. But as we continue, we need a [full guide of C++](http://e-maxx.ru/bookz/files/stroustrup.pdf).
